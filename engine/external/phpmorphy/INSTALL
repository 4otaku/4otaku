For proper work you need phpMorphy library and one of dictionaries.
Download each one from http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmorphy/

-- INSTALL LIBRARY
 - untar archive and include ./src/common.php in your script

-- INSTALL DICTIONARY
 - untar archive with dict to any directory(i suggest ./dicts directory in phpMorphy dir). Use this directory when create
   dict descriptor(phpMorphy_FilesBundle) in script.
